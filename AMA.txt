Today we are going to tell you about our project "ProjectName".
It's augmented-reality mobile app that helps its users to make your
building more attractive for townspeople and potentional customers.
-So, how can it help you?
-It compares appearence of your facade with the most attactive examples 
and tries to apply the most valued elements on your facade.
The only thing you need tot do is direct our camera on facade . 
Then you will see facade which was offered you by the app.
New facade will be shown in real time, so you need just move your camera to
see the most pretty image of your facade.

Who is our target?
There are 3 categories of people, who would like to use our app.
The first category is business owner.
They have to know that hood design of 
a facade can attract new customers, and new customers mean more profit.
The second category - urban-design studios.
The app helps users to see like their fasade will look in the future. It also can help to avoid argues with the client. App will proove to 
the client that your design is better and you don't need to make any edits.
App can count attraction by information, collected in its databases.
The third category is city administrations.
If you are a mayor of the city or you can influent on desicions of city
administration and you care about image of your city you can save some money
of city budget by making some parts of designer's work cheaper.

The Urgency of the Problem
Design code is actively integrated in many cities. It helps to make 
streets have one style which increases business attractiveness and 
creates comfortable city enviroment. Furthermore Izhevsk was chosen to be 
the capital of design in Russia. The own design code is being developed in the
city. So, it give some guarantees of relevance of our app in the future.
